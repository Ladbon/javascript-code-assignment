# JavaScript Code Assignment

## Description

This is a small assignment which is based on a simple task:

* Given an array of numbers 0 to 9, square them and categorize odd and even numbers.

The assignment code is purposely impure, incomplete and not fully functional, so that there is room to polish it and make it work.

The assignment should not have to last more than an hour, but please spend more if you find it desirable.

The assignment can be completed at home or pair-programmed during the interview.

The follow-up discussion will be focused around the assignment code, any other unrelated questions will be provided in advance so that the candidate will not be put on the spot, this gives them time for consideration as they also would be given during normal working circumstances.

It is OK to review and discuss any reference solutions as well, as the interview is not supposed to be a "gotcha" moment, but a learning experience for both parts.

## Requirements

1. Fork and clone the repo, create a new branch from main and name it `assignment/<your-name-here>`. Make the repository public.

2. Fix the existing piece of code in **./test.js** so that the unit tests pass. Assert the functionality by executing `npm run test`. When the unit tests pass you can assume that the code works as intended. There will also be a nice looking table logged to the console.

3. Refactor the code to make it as clean, pure, readable, beautiful, etc. to the extent that you desire. Here you can make use of the unit tests to assure that the code works as intended. *There is lots of improvement potential in the assignment code*.

4. Make sure to document any findings, peculiarities or reasonings in order to be prepared for the code review.

5. Commit, push the changes and open a PR towards the `main` branch and copy the link to the pull request and send it to the reviewer. Add some comments (for instance from step 4) to the PR if you so prefer.


## Getting started

```shell

> git clone https://github.com/perjo927/javascript-code-assignment.git

> cd javascript-code-assignment.git

> npm install

> npm test

```

You will find that the tests fail initially, hence the first task is to adjust that particular bug in **./test.js**. 

## Assessment

The completed requirements in conjunction with a follow-up code review / discussion will quickly assess the candidate's understanding of:

- JavaScript
- Unit testing
- Git
- Communication
- Collaboration (if pair programming is used)
